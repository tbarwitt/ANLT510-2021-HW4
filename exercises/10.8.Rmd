## Excercise 10.8

__In Section 10.2.3, a formula for calculating PVE was given in Equation 10.8. We also saw that the PVE can be obtained using the sdev output of the prcomp() function.__

__On the USArrests data, calculate PVE in two ways:__

a. __Using the sdev output of the `prcomp()` function, as was done in Section 10.2.3.__

<!-- enter your solution here -->

b. __By applying Equation 10.8 directly. That is, use the prcomp() function to compute the principal component loadings. Then, use those loadings in Equation 10.8 to obtain the PVE.__
