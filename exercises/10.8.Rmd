## Excercise 10.8

__In Section 10.2.3, a formula for calculating PVE was given in Equation 10.8. We also saw that the PVE can be obtained using the sdev output of the prcomp() function.__

__On the USArrests data, calculate PVE in two ways:__

a. __Using the sdev output of the `prcomp()` function, as was done in Section 10.2.3.__

```{r}
pr.out <- prcomp(USArrests, scale = TRUE)
pr.var <- pr.out$sdev^2
pve <- pr.var / sum(pr.var)
sum(pr.var)
```
```{r}
pve
```


b. __By applying Equation 10.8 directly. That is, use the prcomp() function to compute the principal component loadings. Then, use those loadings in Equation 10.8 to obtain the PVE.__

```{r}
loadings <- pr.out$rotation
USArrests2 <- scale(USArrests)
sumvar <- sum(apply(as.matrix(USArrests2)^2, 2, sum))
apply((as.matrix(USArrests2) %*% loadings)^2, 2, sum) / sumvar
```
