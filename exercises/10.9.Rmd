## Excercise 10.9

__Consider the USArrests data. We will now perform hierarchical clustering on the states.__

a. __Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean distance, cluster the states.__

<!-- enter your solution here -->

b. __Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?__

<!-- enter your solution here -->

c. __Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation one.__

<!-- enter your solution here -->

d. __What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be scaled before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed? Provide a justification for your answer.__
