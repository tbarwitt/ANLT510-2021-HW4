## Excercise 10.7

__In the chapter, we mentioned the use of correlation-based distance and Euclidean distance as dissimilarity measures for hierarchical clustering. It turns out that these two measures are almost equivalent: if each observation has been centered to have mean zero and standard deviation one, and if we let $r_{ij}$ denote the correlation between the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ observations, then the quantity $1âˆ’r_{ij}$ is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance between the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ observations.__

__On the USArrests data, show that this proportionality holds. Hint: The Euclidean distance can be calculated using the `dist()` function, and correlations can be calculated using the `cor()` function.__
